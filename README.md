Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization, has reached out for assistance with their customer and transactions data. They have shared three datasets containing transaction data, customer demographics, and customer addresses. 

In this project, my goal is to clean, combine, and analyze these datasets to create a comprehensive report that will effectively optimize their marketing strategy. By diving into the data, we can uncover valuable insights and make decisions to enhance their marketing efforts.
